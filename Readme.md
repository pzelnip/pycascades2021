## Core Python Devs on how COVID has Changed Core Python Development

Nina hosted, panelists: Guido, Carol, Brett, Mariatta

### Has being at home been less productive for you (for OSS)?

* Brett: depends on time of year
* Mar: same for her, already working from home. 2 kids who didn't go to school for awhile, hard to juggle competing priorities.
* Carol: definitely less productive. Emotional toll.
* Guido: was tehcnically not working when COVID hit.  Kept active for awhile, then parks were shut down, etc, then things changed.  Pattern matching PEP review process was frustrating/drawn out.  Ultimately left retirement & went to MS.

### Now With Covid, how have you all recreated collaboration virtually?

* Mar: Python Language Summit, had to cancel in-person, last minute decided to do virtual.  Planned in very short time.  Virtual sprint in Oct, # of PRs was not comparable to prior years.
* Guido: agreed, as virtual events go Oct sprint was the best he attended, but still full of distractions (family in background, etc).  Different people dominate conversations, etc.  Lots of positive things, but at end of the day is very different (in person rejuvenates you, etc, no immersion).
* Carol: productive in a different way, convos were focussed differently
* Brett: less organic conversations, no 24/7 imemersion, no accidental overhearing of convos that you join in

### Do You Feel Like Communication Has Been Harder Or Easier With Folks Now That You Re All Virtual Any Miscommunications Due To Not Being In Person Any Tech Discussions That Have Been Put On Hold

* Brett: internal communication has been the same.  Were already geo dispersed, etc. Tech discussions rarely get put off.  Not aware of any examples of being put off
* Guido: particular person was unavailable, had he been available at conference process would have been speedier.  On the plus side until March never occurred to use Zoom for certain types of connections with other core devs. For certain things, can be very useful.  For some people interaction style is very different over Zoom than say email, etc.
* Carol: (missed what she said here)
* Nina: empathy is important, don't know what people are going through right now (kids, depression, etc)

### How has diversity/mentoring intitiative been going and has COVID made that more challenging?

* Guido: currently mentoring 1.5 people (woman & person from SE Asia). In both cases going better than before. Being able to hop on Zoom occasionally has been helpful.
* Mar: had session about this in mentored sprints, had some action items, some have been slow going. Its something that many do think a lot about, but time has been a challenge.
* Carol: travelling to conferences was how I got people interested in core Python, now that's harder.  Finding opportunities to encourage/be positive to new core devs.

### Share hints about any new python features you're excited about?

* Brett, Carol & Guido: pattern matching!
* Brett: working on standard for lock file.
* Carol: moving issues to Github(?) (much credit from other panelists to Mar)

### Audience question: Guido: any plans to integrate Python further into Excel?

(everybody laughed)

* Guido: the formula language will never be rplaced with Python.  That's been looked at, but not feasible (too confusing).  Where he sees openings: maybe extensions that run in the cloud particularly on mobile.  The ideas are with the Excel team

### Audience question: how does the mentoring work, and when do you think a person is ready to be mentored?

* Carol: it starts whenever you take the initiative you wish to contirbute to core python.  Separate contributing to core is different than being a core dev.  Having basic skills like using Git & Github should be fostered first.
* Mar: in general (in any OS project), its rare that you would have a dedicated mentor mentoring you.  I was very lucky to have Guido.  You as the mentee are the one in charge, to seek help, start your journey without waiting, ask questions, etc.  Its your own journey, we don't know what you need to know, or where you would be able to help.

### What are you doing to stay connected with community remotely?

* Brett: I'm on the sterring council so I have a weekly touchpoint to hang out.  Check discourse & Twitter, try to participate.  But it is a little tough as it's not the same as a full-day Pycon hangout.  Does take more effort.
* Carol: trying to answer questions on Pyladies.  Much of scientific community was already distributed.  Mentoring some other people who are learning Python.  Trying to bring in people when teaching.
* Guido: same boat as Brett, miss in person connections, but hitting up online spots: Bug tracker, pull requests, mailing lists, etc.
* Mar: similar thing, mailing list, discord, pyladies slack.  Continue speaking at conferences virtually (hated at first).
* Carol: I miss the travel!
* Mar: I do too but nice to not have to be separated from family
* Brett: I miss the people, not the airplanes

### Wrap up: anything you'd like to share?

* Brett: thank you for being here, thanks to Nina!  Community at this conference is awesome
* Carol: Ptyhon has always been such a key part of research going on to resolve things in scientific community, has remained positive which is amazing.  So many people care so much about moving things forward is inspiring.
* Mar: echo all that.  "Here for the language, staying for the community".  I get asked a lot about how Python is better than other communities, but I don't know, but I stay because of you all.
